# Merge Sort
This folder contains the analysis and comparison of the merge sort with 
Naive sorting techniques which are in O(n<sup>2</sup>)
Comparison of the two techniques:

# Closest Pair Problem
Comparison of the Divide and Conquer methodology for finding closest pair of points
versus the naive approach of O(n-square).
The **NlogN vs Closest Pair - Table.png** shows the different run times for both the 
algorithms

naive approach
