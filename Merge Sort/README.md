# Merge Sort Algorithm Analysis

The Merge sort algorithm in the repository is compared with a O(n^2) naive sorting algorithm
also in the repository.

The **Merge vs Naive - Numbers.png** shows the different runtimes for the different algorithms
for different n-values to be sorted

The **Merge vs Naive Sort.jpeg** shows the same in a pictorial way. We can clearly see from 
the figure that the naive sort increases in O(n^2).
